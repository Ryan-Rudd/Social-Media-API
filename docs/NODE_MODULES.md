### 1. **Core Modules**

- **'express'**: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It is the backbone of the API, handling routing, middleware, and HTTP requests.
- **'mongoose'**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling library for Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution to model your application data, allowing easy interaction with MongoDB.
- **'passport'**: Middleware for authentication in Node.js applications. It supports a wide range of authentication strategies and is essential for managing user sessions and authentication.
- **'passport-local'**: A Passport strategy for authenticating with a username and password. It is used for local authentication, ensuring that users can log in with their credentials.
- **'jsonwebtoken'**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is used for securing APIs via tokens, enabling stateless authentication.

### 2. **Utility Modules**

- **'dotenv'**: Loads environment variables from a '.env' file into 'process.env'. This is essential for managing sensitive configuration settings like API keys and database URLs securely.
- **'bcrypt'**: A library for hashing passwords. It is used to securely store user passwords in the database by hashing them before saving.
- **'morgan'**: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. It logs incoming requests, which is useful for monitoring and debugging the API during development and production.
- **'helmet'**: Helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. It provides basic security protections, such as preventing clickjacking, XSS, and other vulnerabilities.
- **'cors'**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It allows the API to accept requests from different domains, which is essential for APIs that serve web applications hosted on different domains.
- **'express-validator'**: A set of Express.js middlewares that wraps validator.js validator and sanitizer functions. It is used for validating and sanitizing incoming request data to ensure it meets the required format and constraints.
- **'express-rate-limit'**: Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express. It helps prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make in a given time period, protecting against denial-of-service attacks.
- **'multer'**: Middleware for handling 'multipart/form-data', which is primarily used for uploading files. It allows users to upload images, videos, and other files to the API.
- **'nodemailer'**: A module for sending emails from Node.js applications. It is used for sending verification emails, password reset links, and other notifications to users.
- **'winston'**: A versatile logger for Node.js applications. It provides a way to log messages to different transports, such as files, databases, and the console, which is essential for monitoring and debugging.
- **'compression'**: Middleware to compress response bodies for all requests. It reduces the size of the response body, improving the speed and performance of the API.
- **'mongoose-paginate-v2'**: A pagination plugin for Mongoose. It simplifies adding pagination to Mongoose queries, making it easier to manage large datasets in API responses.

### 3. **Development Modules**

- **'nodemon'**: Automatically restarts the application when file changes in the directory are detected. It is useful during development to avoid manually restarting the server every time changes are made.
